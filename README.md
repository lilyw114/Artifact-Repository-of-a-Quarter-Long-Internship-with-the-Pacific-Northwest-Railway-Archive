**NOTE: Each of the weekly journal posts may be found in this README.md markdown file. The remainder of the quarterly projects (five assignments in total) may be found within the "Assigned Coursework" file within this repository. Assignment five contains images of the products of my work with my host organization, and each of the other projects relate to my student progress through the quarter.**

**Week One Reflections and Summary: Dated 06/26/2023**

***The following log documents my journey through the UW iSchool's course LIS 590A: Directed Fieldwork, instructed by Helene Williams. This course requires students to find a host site (person or organization) willing to provide training in exchange for student contribution towards larger projects or goals. In my own case, I have connected with Drs. Tom Phillips and Ann Hidalgo of the Open Access Digital Theological Library. This summer, I will create and publish digital collections in the DTL using the Online Computer Library Center. More than anything, I am looking forward to creating something tangible that I could show to future employers as evidence of competency and vested interest in digital curation, as I anticipate a career in similar fields. My experience with computer technology is slightly more limited than my peers, so this internship should also help to mend any gaps in my knowledge of back-end website maintenance.***
