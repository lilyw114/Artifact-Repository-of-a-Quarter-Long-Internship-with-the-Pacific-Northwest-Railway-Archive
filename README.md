# Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive

**NOTE: Each of the weekly journal posts may be found in this README.md markdown file. The remainder of the quarterly projects (five assignments in total) may be found within the "Assigned Coursework" file within this repository. Assignment five contains images of the products of my work with my host organization, and each of the other projects relate to my student progress through the quarter.**

**Week One Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/06/2023**

***The following log documents my journey through the UW iSchool's course LIS 590A: Directed Fieldwork, instructed by Helene Williams. This course requires students to find a host site (person or organization) willing to provide training in exchange for student contribution towards larger projects or goals. In my case, I have partnered with Dean O'Neill and the Pacific Northwest Railway Archive in Burien, where I currently live. This Autumn Quarter, I will learn how to digitize and preserve archived materials such as maps, develop superior finding aids and standards of cataloging, integrate data in .XSLX files, and work with various scans, negatives, and prints. Above all, I anticipate the development of my sense of agency in managing a diverse set of materials, based on prior coursework I have taken at UW: such as Intro to XML, Organization of Information and Resources, and Data Curation. My experience with scanners and their associated software is low, but my comfort with Excel is 'off the charts', so to speak. With Dean's guidance, I hope that I will accomplish the work of a fully-fledged information professional***

***My AToM training began last Tuesday, 09/26/2023, ten days after the PNRA's conference in Tacoma had ended. Regrettably, I was not able to attend because of a birthday celebration, but heading into the archive I heard so many great things about the presentations. What struck me at first was the care put into the organization's headquarters. There were paintings of steam engines, wooden hoops for the delivery of orders to the conductor, various glass lamps in different shades, and thematic calendars across the walls with various native tribes portrayed on the front. Dean showed me to the office first, where I met my colleage Alex, who attends University of Denver. After a chat about how our days would proceed, I was left to speak with Virginia about my status as an intern. She offered me two books to read about millenials in museums and women on the railroad. Then, Dean took me downtairs into the library, a great room of sliding shelves recovered from a hospital, similar to the archives at UW. He explained the cataloging system, introduced the computer systems and hard drives, and ushered us into a small library. There, it was explained that an excess of donations of unrelated subjects are regularly donated to the various Rail History Organizations, of which there are five, pertaining to separate regions of the country. I was truly amazed at how much goes on in such a small space.***

***While Alex briefed me on the file naming conventions and I browsed the PNRA's digitization standards manual, Dean began scanning maps with another senior volunteer. My usual chatty self began speaking to the adult members of the group and found the oldest to have been a telegrapher at my age. Another invited me to join his HAM radio club, and another explained to me the history of AOL. As an anthropology major, I was delighted to meet these people and hear their stories. I went home at 4:00, after fussing with the scanners with Dean and scrolling up maps of Redmond and Tacoma.***

***Unforunately, the following Monday I contracted the Eris variant of COVID-19, and fell extremely ill. Although I was sleeping some 20 hours a day, Dean kindly offered me a portable hard drive to work from home, correcting outdated PNRA map file scan names. He has been such a positive influence on me this quarter, as has Alex, and both are my motivators. When I return on Tuesday to complete my Learning Outcomes Agreement with Dean (a little late, thanks to COVID), I should surely let them know.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Two Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/09/2023**

***My work for weeks two and three will be conducted at home using the aforementioned hard drive. My condition is improving, but I can't risk endangering any of the other volunteers with this illness. So far, that work from home process has involved updating the names of maps from Washington and Idaho. The digitization standards of the PNRA are constantly evolving, so I am shifting dashes to underscores and commas to plain text in order to keep with the times.***

***For a while, I was incredibly sick and completely incapacitated, but as the days progress I have more energy for working. It's frustraing to feel stuck, but I am thankful for the generosity of the archive in giving me something purposeful to do with the time I spend at home.***

***When I return, masked up this coming Thursday the 12th, I will launch into developing my LOA with my supervisor Dean, breaking down the tasks I want to pursue this quarter in detail, and recieving an in-depth tour of the prints and negatives by a specialist just one week later. It's a dynamic time for me, just starting out, and the hours lost will be easily replaced once I hone my focus with Dean. In coming weeks, I will attempt to arrange a capstone project in partnership with the PNRA, and I'm still working through the recommended literature in time for my return to the archive.***

***For now, I am trapped at home, but the upside is that I am becoming very comfortable with renaming files according to internal standards, and troubleshooting with my supervisor where issues occur. By Thursday, I should have more to say on this matter.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Three Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/16/2023**

***Thankfully, the updating of file names to the standard of the PNRA was completed, all of which being maps from BNSF in various boxes related to the Washington-Idaho region. Four outstanding boxes pertain to Montana, but many of those maps do not have proper names yet, and will be adressed later on. However, it felt nice to have been able to complete some work while still at home, although I was very nervous about returning to the office and infecting somebody. I masked up for the day of my return.***

***As soon as I got back to work, Dean was there to welcome me and help me choose my areas of focus for the quarter from a short list of tasks the PNRA would like to see managed in the near future. This "shopping list" included developing a finding aid for the finding aids, a set of standard Excel catalog templates, working with AccessToMemory's system of uploads for images of scans/negatives/prints/slides/etc., performing a de-acesssioing sweep of the archive, a new set of digitization standards, and a bid to reduce file duplication on the PNRA servers. In a small way, I had already helped with that last one a little bit, because several of the maps I flagged were dupliacated in the WA-ID boxes.***

***The other intern from University of Denver, Alex, began working on the de-accessioning and scanning, so I chose to work with the standard Excel templates, making a finding aid for their finding aids, and perhaps working with digitization standards while scannign maps with Dean. It seemed like a lot, especially considering my recent illness, but Dean reminded me that the hours pass very quickly and it's important to stay focused on one thing at a time.***

***That Thursday, I met with my supervisors Dean, Russ, and Virginia, and we hashed out a plan for the Excel catalog templates. It would begin with a "lisetening tour" to gague shareholder interest, identify some drawbacks, and see who wants to see what in the final versions. I was forewarned that since the archive is staffed by many volunteers, each with their own pet project, it would be hard to find a middle ground. What's more important to Dean is that what we develop in the end is actionable and easily distributed, as well as providing a place for the updated file names we had worked on previously.***

***It's going to be hard to pick up where I left off, especially as the COVID has wreaked absolute havoc on my mood. However, all things begin with small steps, and my supervisors are being incredibly generous with me during this learning process.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Four Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/23/2023**

***The listening tour has begun! To keep it simple, I ask the people with whom I meet five questions. Here they are: "Why would a new set of templates be beneficial to the PNRA?", "What are some drawbacks or 'gotchas!' to consider during the process?", "What are your personal desired outcomes for the final draft?", "Who else should I speak with?" and "Any final thoughts?". Dean felt that these questions keep it short, sweet, to the point, and also identify other potential sources of insight. As the PNRA is built of five Rail History Organizations (RHOs), the local representative of each would be given a chance to voice their input before being offered the final tool. Besides that, Virginia and Dean would also be interviewed as people who attend to the knowledge management of the workplace.***

***Dean's general thinking was that .XLS was strongly preferred for inventory, but apart from that, we'd need to consdider what items deserved their own lists. At present, there is no permanent storage for such lists. So, in order to standardize the existing spreadsheets of the archive, a proposal of a template for data entry will be drafted and presented via PowerPoint to the other arhchive volunteers. After that time, a final draft can be made and uploaded to the server for daily use. He assured me there would be many tough calls to make, as the templates would not be railroad specific, but should be friendly to AccessToMemory, the online storage system the archive relies upon. Not knowing enough to disagree, I just took notes!***

***Being in the room with her when the plan was proposed, Dean and I decided to begin interviewing Virginia first. Her general incliniations were in line with her role at the archive, and she mainly was concerned with helping those around the PNRA do their work consistently and comfortably. She proposed a group debrief/SOP meeting when the project is finished, with handouts to make sure that everyone is on the same page. She recommended we speak with the third supervisor, Russ, although he is not in the office on many of the same days that I am there. Her main concerns with drawbacks were low popularity.***

***After the listening tour concludes, Dean wants to bring me up to speed with the current spreadsheet headers, and get a feel of what's out there before I begin proposing something new. That means identiying the types of items in storage, their properties, and finding ways to preserve metadata while not cluttering the spreadsheets, making data entry difficult, or interefering with searching and recall by AToM.***

***It's good to be back on track! I just hope I can pull it off, and make enough hours not to fail my supervisors and this course.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Five Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/30/2023**

***Happy (almost) Halloween! This year, I'm showing up as a cat. When I brought my ears and tail to work on Thursday, the PNRA members thought it was delightful, although I was embarrassed to be the only one there in costume...***

***For a good part of the week I was upstairs helping Dean and a volunteer named Chris re-organize and put away some of the model-building materials, books, DVDs, and other merchandise they sell at meetups and swaps around the state. They were cataloged extremely prescisely with "N-Numbers" for Northern Pacific Railway, and it was challenging to find exactly where something went, but things moved quickly nonetheless.***

***The rest of the week I spent intervieweing Russ, Rich, Kurt, Bob, and Gary, the rest of the supervisors and chairpeople of the various railroads in the RHO group. Each had their own biases, fairly predictable towards their priority within the archive. Dean, Virginia, and Russ cared more about user experience and feasibility, and the RHO leaders prioritized standardizing information in a way their RHO would accept and readily integrate with as little training as possible. Rich and Gary in particular were great insights into the AToM system and searchability, especially where the placement and title of certain columns was concerned. For instance, columns such as "Notes" or "Comments" would be condensed into a single searchable field called "Scope/context."***

***Although Dean and I haven't quite knocked the spreadsheets out of the park yet, he'd like me to think a little bit more on the third project I'll achieve, and how to get started. I believe ATom training would be too time consuming, and he agrees, so we're going to slowly move towards the finding aid for the finding aids.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Six Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/6/2023**

***October came and went unceremoniously, despite my cat ears at work. Dean has set me up to begin studying finding aids A-Z in the various collections of the PNRA archive mirror drive. After leafing through hudreds of spreadsheets and charting their similarities and differences, I came up with a simple chart to outline which headings I'd like to see in a universal template.***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/eed3545e-aaf9-4a57-86cb-747b6b17a060)

***From this chart, I spoke with other volunteers and my supervisors and concluded that bibliography and profiles and timetables were too sparse to have their own mentions. So, we decided to group them under "Railroad Documents". Likewise, photomedia became "Images", as it was broader and more accepting of scanned objects. From there, I performed a second sweep of the finding aids and drafted a new chart. The yellow-highlighted fields with blue stars are AToM-compliant fields, and the rest are fields I commonly encountered among existing finding aids. Have a look!***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/6c7a68ea-337b-477a-abd6-d0ca372a4411)

***With time, this chart will help me not only to determine the fields I need for my universal and categorical spreadsheets, but also to organize a finding aid for the finding aids which is concise, inclusive, and easily accessible. When I meet with Dean next, on Monday, I'll be able to present my first drafts of templates, and if he approves, they'll be put into the final PowerPoint proposal before being edited and uploaded to the server.***

***There is so much to be excited about, but precious few hours left to work. I'm only at 60 hours at this point, but will make it to 150 with some home assignments and increased shifts at the archive. If I can pull off all three projects, I will be so proud! If not, it's likely I'll come by after the internship has terminated as a volunteer!***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Week Seven Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/13/2023**

***My "finding aid for the finding aids" has come to fruition! Dean and I presented a fifteen minute PowerPoint of my process and final product to Virginia (a set of four Excel templates), including time for questioning. Her largest concerns were with accessibility given the volunteer base here at the PNRA, and with the general acceptance of one single standard for data entry after ten years of completely randomized standards for metadata storage. Honestly, I felt I was able to respond well, especially given my detailed notes from the listening tour and adherence to Web Content Accesibility Guidelines as well as AToM compliance by design. To access the PowerPoint, look for "Excel Catalog Template PowerPoint Presentation.pdf" within the folder "Assigned Coursework". It's a bit spartan, but that is what Dean requested. In the meantime, take a look at my Photos template with an entire Phillips slide collection that I cataloged all my myself!***

***Each slide is about the size of a postage stamp, but packed with color and detail, which can be seen when held to the light. Dean taught me to scan them using a special set of plastic holders, after brushing dust away with a camel hair paintbrush (visible in the image) and a can of air duster. So beautiful!***

***Do bear in mind that these images were scanned at 4800 dots per inch, which is six times the level of detail that the United States Geological Survey maintains for their raster data. Absolutely incredible, even when blown up so large on the computer monitor, the details are minute. I am young and slides were before my time, but it is spectacular and far outpaces photographs in my opinion, in terms of storage capability. However, a few members of the archive did share that slides are vulnerable to chemical damagage, UV damage, and corruption.***

***On an unrelated but cheery note, my grandparents are going to lend me their collection of slides from the 1970s so that I can digitize them at home! One more wonderful benefit of my time at the PNRA.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Eight Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/20/2023**

***More scanning and more scanning! After the Phillips collection of 75 slides, I have begun clearing up a list of all internal PNRA files from their SharePoint server, by downloading a copy of the file and moving it to Excel where I am able to manipulate the columns and integrate the data with my Excel catalog templates. It is a massive undertaking, and the uploading of the file alone took nearly an hour. Any touch to the already powerful archive computers sends Excel into a tailspin, but somehow, it got done. Thankfully, there's always more to do at the archive, and I was able to bounce between chatting with volunteers and scanning a couple of the endless supply of Jim Frederickson maps. Frederickson is one of the first and largest donors to the archive, and there are abour 20 boxes of maps in the attic which Dean and I have begun to slowly unbox, label, scan, rename, delete old files, rebox, relabel, and replace.***

***One of those boxes, unpacked, typically looks like this beside the wide format scanner. After unboxing, unfurling, and taping together delicate mechanical drawing edges, those not already in the system (checked with a quick Ctrl+F and their aforementioned N-number by Dean and me upstairs) get their dog ears flattened by burnishing against the head of the scanner, and if still resistent, slipped into a mylar casing before scanning. Then, they must be rolled up again, using pill canisters full of airsoft pellets as weights while rolling, and tucked away forever.***

***Although I want so badly to persevere with these initiatives, I must admit that my health is declining. The days feel extremely long when I haven't slept at all for a few nights in a row, and the maps are truly endless regardless of what I do. What helps is the warm coffee and endless supply of cookies and candy always left out at the archive...somehow, I have mysteriously gained three pounds!***
