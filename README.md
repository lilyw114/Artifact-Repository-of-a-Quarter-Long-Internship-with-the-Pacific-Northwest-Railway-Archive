# Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive

**NOTE: Each of the weekly journal posts may be found in this README.md markdown file. The remainder of the quarterly projects (five assignments in total) may be found within the "Assigned Coursework" file within this repository. Assignment five contains images of the products of my work with my host organization, and each of the other projects relate to my student progress through the quarter.** 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week One Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/06/2023**

***The following log documents my journey through the UW iSchool's course LIS 590A: Directed Fieldwork, instructed by Helene Williams. This course requires students to find a host site (person or organization) willing to provide training in exchange for student contribution towards larger projects or goals. In my case, I have partnered with Dean O'Neill and the Pacific Northwest Railway Archive in Burien, where I currently live. This Autumn Quarter, I will learn how to digitize and preserve archived materials such as maps, develop superior finding aids and standards of cataloging, integrate data in .XSLX files, and work with various scans, negatives, and prints. Above all, I anticipate the development of my sense of agency in managing a diverse set of materials, based on prior coursework I have taken at UW: such as Intro to XML, Organization of Information and Resources, and Data Curation. My experience with scanners and their associated software is low, but my comfort with Excel is 'off the charts', so to speak. With Dean's guidance, I hope that I will accomplish the work of a fully-fledged information professional***

***My AToM training began last Tuesday, 09/26/2023, ten days after the PNRA's conference in Tacoma had ended. Regrettably, I was not able to attend because of a birthday celebration, but heading into the archive I heard so many great things about the presentations. What struck me at first was the care put into the organization's headquarters. There were paintings of steam engines, wooden hoops for the delivery of orders to the conductor, various glass lamps in different shades, and thematic calendars across the walls with various native tribes portrayed on the front. Dean showed me to the office first, where I met my colleage Alex, who attends University of Denver. After a chat about how our days would proceed, I was left to speak with Virginia about my status as an intern. She offered me two books to read about millenials in museums and women on the railroad. Then, Dean took me downtairs into the library, a great room of sliding shelves recovered from a hospital, similar to the archives at UW. He explained the cataloging system, introduced the computer systems and hard drives, and ushered us into a small library. There, it was explained that an excess of donations of unrelated subjects are regularly donated to the various Rail History Organizations, of which there are five, pertaining to separate regions of the country. I was truly amazed at how much goes on in such a small space.***

***While Alex briefed me on the file naming conventions and I browsed the PNRA's digitization standards manual, Dean began scanning maps with another senior volunteer. My usual chatty self began speaking to the adult members of the group and found the oldest to have been a telegrapher at my age. Another invited me to join his HAM radio club, and another explained to me the history of AOL. As an anthropology major, I was delighted to meet these people and hear their stories. I went home at 4:00, after fussing with the scanners with Dean and scrolling up maps of Redmond and Tacoma.***

***Unforunately, the following Monday I contracted the Eris variant of COVID-19, and fell extremely ill. Although I was sleeping some 20 hours a day, Dean kindly offered me a portable hard drive to work from home, correcting outdated PNRA map file scan names. He has been such a positive influence on me this quarter, as has Alex, and both are my motivators. When I return on Tuesday to complete my Learning Outcomes Agreement with Dean (a little late, thanks to COVID), I should surely let them know.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Two Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/09/2023**

***My work for weeks two and three will be conducted at home using the aforementioned hard drive. My condition is improving, but I can't risk endangering any of the other volunteers with this illness. So far, that work from home process has involved updating the names of maps from Washington and Idaho. The digitization standards of the PNRA are constantly evolving, so I am shifting dashes to underscores and commas to plain text in order to keep with the times.***

***For a while, I was incredibly sick and completely incapacitated, but as the days progress I have more energy for working. It's frustraing to feel stuck, but I am thankful for the generosity of the archive in giving me something purposeful to do with the time I spend at home.***

***When I return, masked up this coming Thursday the 12th, I will launch into developing my LOA with my supervisor Dean, breaking down the tasks I want to pursue this quarter in detail, and recieving an in-depth tour of the prints and negatives by a specialist just one week later. It's a dynamic time for me, just starting out, and the hours lost will be easily replaced once I hone my focus with Dean. In coming weeks, I will attempt to arrange a capstone project in partnership with the PNRA, and I'm still working through the recommended literature in time for my return to the archive.***

***For now, I am trapped at home, but the upside is that I am becoming very comfortable with renaming files according to internal standards, and troubleshooting with my supervisor where issues occur. By Thursday, I should have more to say on this matter.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Three Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/16/2023**

***Thankfully, the updating of file names to the standard of the PNRA was completed, all of which being maps from BNSF in various boxes related to the Washington-Idaho region. Four outstanding boxes pertain to Montana, but many of those maps do not have proper names yet, and will be adressed later on. However, it felt nice to have been able to complete some work while still at home, although I was very nervous about returning to the office and infecting somebody. I masked up for the day of my return.***

***As soon as I got back to work, Dean was there to welcome me and help me choose my areas of focus for the quarter from a short list of tasks the PNRA would like to see managed in the near future. This "shopping list" included developing a finding aid for the finding aids, a set of standard Excel catalog templates, working with AccessToMemory's system of uploads for images of scans/negatives/prints/slides/etc., performing a de-acesssioing sweep of the archive, a new set of digitization standards, and a bid to reduce file duplication on the PNRA servers. In a small way, I had already helped with that last one a little bit, because several of the maps I flagged were dupliacated in the WA-ID boxes.***

***The other intern from University of Denver, Alex, began working on the de-accessioning and scanning, so I chose to work with the standard Excel templates, making a finding aid for their finding aids, and perhaps working with digitization standards while scannign maps with Dean. It seemed like a lot, especially considering my recent illness, but Dean reminded me that the hours pass very quickly and it's important to stay focused on one thing at a time.***

***That Thursday, I met with my supervisors Dean, Russ, and Virginia, and we hashed out a plan for the Excel catalog templates. It would begin with a "lisetening tour" to gague shareholder interest, identify some drawbacks, and see who wants to see what in the final versions. I was forewarned that since the archive is staffed by many volunteers, each with their own pet project, it would be hard to find a middle ground. What's more important to Dean is that what we develop in the end is actionable and easily distributed, as well as providing a place for the updated file names we had worked on previously.***

***It's going to be hard to pick up where I left off, especially as the COVID has wreaked absolute havoc on my mood. However, all things begin with small steps, and my supervisors are being incredibly generous with me during this learning process.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Four Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/23/2023**

***The listening tour has begun! To keep it simple, I ask the people with whom I meet five questions. Here they are: "Why would a new set of templates be beneficial to the PNRA?", "What are some drawbacks or 'gotchas!' to consider during the process?", "What are your personal desired outcomes for the final draft?", "Who else should I speak with?" and "Any final thoughts?". Dean felt that these questions keep it short, sweet, to the point, and also identify other potential sources of insight. As the PNRA is built of five Rail History Organizations (RHOs), the local representative of each would be given a chance to voice their input before being offered the final tool. Besides that, Virginia and Dean would also be interviewed as people who attend to the knowledge management of the workplace.***

***Dean's general thinking was that .XLS was strongly preferred for inventory, but apart from that, we'd need to consdider what items deserved their own lists. At present, there is no permanent storage for such lists. So, in order to standardize the existing spreadsheets of the archive, a proposal of a template for data entry will be drafted and presented via PowerPoint to the other arhchive volunteers. After that time, a final draft can be made and uploaded to the server for daily use. He assured me there would be many tough calls to make, as the templates would not be railroad specific, but should be friendly to AccessToMemory, the online storage system the archive relies upon. Not knowing enough to disagree, I just took notes!***

***Being in the room with her when the plan was proposed, Dean and I decided to begin interviewing Virginia first. Her general incliniations were in line with her role at the archive, and she mainly was concerned with helping those around the PNRA do their work consistently and comfortably. She proposed a group debrief/SOP meeting when the project is finished, with handouts to make sure that everyone is on the same page. She recommended we speak with the third supervisor, Russ, although he is not in the office on many of the same days that I am there. Her main concerns with drawbacks were low popularity.***

***After the listening tour concludes, Dean wants to bring me up to speed with the current spreadsheet headers, and get a feel of what's out there before I begin proposing something new. That means identiying the types of items in storage, their properties, and finding ways to preserve metadata while not cluttering the spreadsheets, making data entry difficult, or interefering with searching and recall by AToM.***

***It's good to be back on track! I just hope I can pull it off, and make enough hours not to fail my supervisors and this course.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Five Reflections and Summary: Dated 10/30/2023**

***Happy (almost) Halloween! This year, I'm showing up as a cat. When I brought my ears and tail to work on Thursday, the PNRA members thought it was delightful, although I was embarrassed to be the only one there in costume...***

***For a good part of the week I was upstairs helping Dean and a volunteer named Chris re-organize and put away some of the model-building materials, books, DVDs, and other merchandise they sell at meetups and swaps around the state. They were cataloged extremely prescisely with "N-Numbers" for Northern Pacific Railway, and it was challenging to find exactly where something went, but things moved quickly nonetheless.***

***The rest of the week I spent intervieweing Russ, Rich, Kurt, Bob, and Gary, the rest of the supervisors and chairpeople of the various railroads in the RHO group. Each had their own biases, fairly predictable towards their priority within the archive. Dean, Virginia, and Russ cared more about user experience and feasibility, and the RHO leaders prioritized standardizing information in a way their RHO would accept and readily integrate with as little training as possible. Rich and Gary in particular were great insights into the AToM system and searchability, especially where the placement and title of certain columns was concerned. For instance, columns such as "Notes" or "Comments" would be condensed into a single searchable field called "Scope/context."***

***Although Dean and I haven't quite knocked the spreadsheets out of the park yet, he'd like me to think a little bit more on the third project I'll achieve, and how to get started. I believe ATom training would be too time consuming, and he agrees, so we're going to slowly move towards the finding aid for the finding aids.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Six Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/6/2023**

***October came and went unceremoniously, despite my cat ears at work. Dean has set me up to begin studying finding aids A-Z in the various collections of the PNRA archive mirror drive. After leafing through hudreds of spreadsheets and charting their similarities and differences, I came up with a simple chart to outline which headings I'd like to see in a universal template.***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/eed3545e-aaf9-4a57-86cb-747b6b17a060)

***From this chart, I spoke with other volunteers and my supervisors and concluded that bibliography and profiles and timetables were too sparse to have their own mentions. So, we decided to group them under "Railroad Documents". Likewise, photomedia became "Images", as it was broader and more accepting of scanned objects. From there, I performed a second sweep of the finding aids and drafted a new chart. The yellow-highlighted fields with blue stars are AToM-compliant fields, and the rest are fields I commonly encountered among existing finding aids. Have a look!***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/6c7a68ea-337b-477a-abd6-d0ca372a4411)

***With time, this chart will help me not only to determine the fields I need for my universal and categorical spreadsheets, but also to organize a finding aid for the finding aids which is concise, inclusive, and easily accessible. When I meet with Dean next, on Monday, I'll be able to present my first drafts of templates, and if he approves, they'll be put into the final PowerPoint proposal before being edited and uploaded to the server.***

***There is so much to be excited about, but precious few hours left to work. I'm only at 60 hours at this point, but will make it to 150 with some home assignments and increased shifts at the archive. If I can pull off all three projects, I will be so proud! If not, it's likely I'll come by after the internship has terminated as a volunteer!***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Week Seven Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/13/2023**

***My "finding aid for the finding aids" has come to fruition! Dean and I presented a fifteen minute PowerPoint of my process and final product to Virginia (a set of four Excel templates), including time for questioning. Her largest concerns were with accessibility given the volunteer base here at the PNRA, and with the general acceptance of one single standard for data entry after ten years of completely randomized standards for metadata storage. Honestly, I felt I was able to respond well, especially given my detailed notes from the listening tour and adherence to Web Content Accesibility Guidelines as well as AToM compliance by design. To access the PowerPoint, look for "Excel Catalog Template PowerPoint Presentation.pdf" within the folder "Assigned Coursework". It's a bit spartan, but that is what Dean requested. In the meantime, take a look at my Photos template with an entire Phillips slide collection that I cataloged all my myself!***

***Each slide is about the size of a postage stamp, but packed with color and detail, which can be seen when held to the light. Dean taught me to scan them using a special set of plastic holders, after brushing dust away with a camel hair paintbrush (visible in the image) and a can of air duster. So beautiful!***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/1506fb58-79ff-478c-b455-06d7209883ba)

***Do bear in mind that these images were scanned at 4800 dots per inch, which is six times the level of detail that the United States Geological Survey maintains for their raster data. Absolutely incredible, even when blown up so large on the computer monitor, the details are minute. I am young and slides were before my time, but it is spectacular and far outpaces photographs in my opinion, in terms of storage capability. However, a few members of the archive did share that slides are vulnerable to chemical damagage, UV damage, and corruption.***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/424f570f-df8e-4bb3-a882-3f1e9d9a7ffb)

***On an unrelated but cheery note, my grandparents are going to lend me their collection of slides from the 1970s so that I can digitize them at home! One more wonderful benefit of my time at the PNRA.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Eight Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/20/2023**

***More scanning and more scanning! After the Phillips collection of 75 slides, I have begun clearing up a list of all internal PNRA files from their SharePoint server, by downloading a copy of the file and moving it to Excel where I am able to manipulate the columns and integrate the data with my Excel catalog templates. It is a massive undertaking, and the uploading of the file alone took nearly an hour. Any touch to the already powerful archive computers sends Excel into a tailspin, but somehow, it got done. Thankfully, there's always more to do at the archive, and I was able to bounce between chatting with volunteers and scanning a couple of the endless supply of Jim Frederickson maps. Frederickson is one of the first and largest donors to the archive, and there are abour 20 boxes of maps in the attic which Dean and I have begun to slowly unbox, label, scan, rename, delete old files, rebox, relabel, and replace.***


![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/2ab5d7dc-3ff6-4ca6-96e1-31cfff4e038f)

***One of those boxes, unpacked, typically looks like this beside the wide format scanner. After unboxing, unfurling, and taping together delicate mechanical drawing edges, those not already in the system (checked with a quick Ctrl+F and their aforementioned N-number by Dean and me upstairs) get their dog ears flattened by burnishing against the head of the scanner, and if still resistent, slipped into a mylar casing before scanning. Then, they must be rolled up again, using pill canisters full of airsoft pellets as weights while rolling, and tucked away forever.***

***Although I want so badly to persevere with these initiatives, I must admit that my health is declining. The days feel extremely long when I haven't slept at all for a few nights in a row, and the maps are truly endless regardless of what I do. What helps is the warm coffee and endless supply of cookies and candy always left out at the archive...somehow, I have mysteriously gained three pounds!***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Nine Reflections and Summary: Dated 11/27/2023**

***Being totally honest, I missed both days this week due to illness. I have no other excuse; I was just too sick. Each day, I wrote to Dean the night before, or an hour before work, and I feel this was truly disrespectful. However, I kept kicking myself until an hour or a night before because I promised myself that I would go in the next day. My levels of exhaustion are probably hard to understand for somebody who doesn't live with my disability. The less I sleep, the more wired I become, until I am completely delusional and my immune system and heart begin misfunctioning. Above all, I don't want to end up in a hospital with an unknown return date, but it is not acceptable to be absent so often. If there were some way to predict the future, I would opt for that immediately.***

***My other courses at UW are not doing well either. For some reason, I find that I can only sleep between five and seven in the morning, and that's if I take triple the dose of sedatives that I was prescribed at UW this past week. There's nothing else to do but wait, even if that is torture. I don't expect my supervisors to understand, but I have been fully transparent with them as well as my professors. Thankfully, Dean has given me a big box of slides that I can work on slowly at home, annotating each with AToM-compliant Scope & Content fields. More time consuming than you'd think!***

***However embarassing my situation has become, I am very grateful for some small way to contribute. Dean reminds me that it's a volunteer archive about trains, so it's not like there's a gun to my head where deadlines are concerned. This does reflect on myself as an intern, though, and I vow to get well as soon as humanly possible.***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Ten Reflections and Summary: Dated 12/4/2023**

***This week, I applied for two PhD programs in Information Science. One would mean continuing with the UW iSchool. The other is at Penn State, because my sister is there. When I'm so sick at unpredictable times, I need to stay close to family. Dean has been wholly supportive, and Russ even offered to write a letter of recommendation for me if that were necessary. They are wonderful people. Slowly, I seem to be getting better with the adjusted medication regimen, and I have been keeping my doctor on speed dial, pretty much. So, life at the archive has been peaceful. Each of the members has some little Christmas decoration they've posted by their desk: maybe it's a miniature lighted tree, or a snow globe, or some string lights across their monitor.***

***I knew the generational gap was large, but I had to laugh when one member offered to go Wassailing with me!***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/a744c483-ad79-46f5-9673-7c2e250055c3)

***What you're looking at is an incredibly large track profile, which isn't even fully in view. It is likely close to 60 feet long, scanning at around 3GB at 300 dpi. To put that in scale, that's larger than a Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets DVD! All of the members had a laugh watching us scramble to feed it through the scanner, as it came out in huge reams like fresh noodles. I may never witness something so strange again.***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/21ee6e8f-ce62-42a0-9024-68460172b20b)

***My exams are coming up, and I'm frightened that I'm not well enough to continue. The archive is one thing; so bright and friendly and overall just casual. There's not a whole lot of pressure to complete a project so long as one doesn't drown in the diverse array of tasks, and is accomplishing something. But I wonder how the next few weeks will play out given that I'm not back to normal. There have been a few instances where Dean ended the day early or told me to go home because of my sickness, even though I was trying my best. He is a kind person, highly productive, and I know he commutes a great distance to be there supporting me.****

***I just hope everything comes together somehow, because the road ahead feels longer than that map.***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Eleven Reflections and Summary: Dated 12/10/2023**

***Well, I've submitted two exams! The other two, my capstone and this Directed Fieldwork, are on hold. When I was in undergrad, this never happened. The only two times I missed class or submitted late were due to a broken hand in a pen-and-paper law studies exam, and the death of a family member. The shame is intense, but I won't squander the grace the professors have given me and will instead use it to focus on my health, and completing my hours at the PNRA. That's the right thing to do. I know that help is freely offered at UW, but I need to be smart about my recovery tactic at this time, for their sake as well as mine.***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/54c924d9-0459-4c9b-a519-2794964471f1)

***In the meantime, here's something that brightened my day. It's the creek where I used to fish back in Bellingham when I went to Western Washington University...but this map is from 1850. There's something so magical about digitizing the hand-drawn lines of a surveyor who stood exactly where you stand, and the connection which forms between you like a one-way mirror. Nothing like it on Earth, and it's a major motivator for me to continue with this archive position.***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Twelve Reflections and Summary: Dated 12/17/2023**

***Today was a slow day. More 2008 BSNF maps to be scanned, and more files to be named. I alternated between the printer and my desk chair like the seat was a Hibachi grill, but it feels good to stay active. I don't doubt that the company of the other volunteers is keeping me healthy as well. Of course, it feels selfish that this log has devolved into a personal jounrey more than a point of career development and training, but such is the reality of my current situation. Dean has asked me to tally my hours, and it's getting close to the finish line! The other members of the archive are talking about their Christmas plans, and how some are hoping to visit on the 26th this year. I agreed that it would be fun for me, as I'm living so close to the archive. Each day, somebody brings more cookies. Come to think of it, I should be doing that too...***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/eef01aed-e3bf-4564-a3a0-4c6972d252a9)

***No snow this year, except for the massive banks of scrolling white drifts which come across the scanner each half hour. There's something enchanting about the process, like waves of the sea. I love being here. Today, I made my intent very clear to Dean that I wish to stay at the PNRA as a volunteer. He seems happy to hear that, thankfully.***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Thirteen Reflections and Summary: Dated 12/24/2023**

***Merry Christmas to all! Although I was feeling in the mood for some archiving, Dean emailed me today that the archive is closed until the 30th. Bummer! I'm spending the holiday in Bellingham with my grandparents, and heading down to Whatcom Creek, the map for which you've seen above. Besides that, I am sleeping as much and whenever I can, and gearing up for next quarter. It has been a long and exhausting trip this quarter, with many skills to learn and not much time to rest. Obviously, I haven't done a perfect job, but it's in the struggling that so much experience and useful wisdom can be gained. I feel that I have learned more about negotiating with stakeholders through my templates and digitization standards initiatives than I have about archival processes and technology, which is unexpected to say the least!***

***Something that's on my radar for the future is drafing an Emergency Preparedness Plan for the PNRA, perhaps formatted as a poster. It could include response protocols for unforseen distasters, including who to contact and life-saving resources. Given the aging population of the archive, it's one possibility for my future activity post-internship. Here's a little draft I made:***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/376affe8-f2dc-4b75-9301-6349a5449670)

***One of my supervisors, Russ, is a professor at Norwich and his students draft EPP documents regularly. He's going to be a fantastic resource for me in that arena.***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Fourteen Reflections and Summary: Dated 12/31/2023 to 1/3/2024**

***The second of January...2024(!)...was my last official day. All that's left is signing a W-9 so that payment can be arranged, and continuing as a volunteer. To my elation, I've already recieved an email containing a few places where I can help, and a plan to come back in next Tuesday for map scanning! Yippee!***

![image](https://github.com/lilyw114/Artifact-Repository-of-a-Quarter-Long-Internship-with-the-Pacific-Northwest-Railway-Archive/assets/126448804/08e0d7d1-db1f-444b-868b-60fce4ba1808)

***For the purposes of reading, consider my PowerPoint as well as the shared images of template and scanning progress to be my "final artifacts". Most of the work that I have completed is in-house and proprietary. In other words, I don't really have permission to fully disclose. It's not secret, rather it's not mine. My four big projects produced during my time at the PNRA have included: the BNSF map scanning, my digitization standards update, the template development process and product set, the Phillips slides processing. However, what's coming next is my Emergency Preparedness Plan. That will certainly be posted here for records keeping once it is available. It should be a fairly snazzy and comprehensive yet brief guide to disaster response, in the form of a full-gloss poster that I'll produce at the McCarty Makerspace on UW campus.***

***As mentioned in my Final Reflection, available as "Assignment 5" within the folder "Assigned Coursework", my supervisor Dean took me to Panda Express for my final lunch as part of intern tradtion. He shared with me some valuable insights about interview ettiquette, my hits and misses, and how to proceed with my PhD interview process were I to make it to that stage. Actually, I should find out in a week or two, which is terrifying. Although Dean doesn't necesarily understand my disability or the challenges I've faced during my internship, he is a father to three children around my age, and has indispensable widsom towards making decisive career choices. I feel his support and appreciate it more than I could possibly express. My labors towards the PNRA shopping list of goals are accounted for, and I feel welcome as a part of their volunteer community...although I am almost 50 years younger than nearly everyone else.***

***The mission of the iSchool is to promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion through educational opporutnities, and thankfully, I feel this is something I've been able to enact as a part of my internship. Working with seniors, some near 100 years of age, on complex technological objectives in order to digitize materials otherwise lost to history for new Internet audiences feels at the perfect intersection of iSchool IDEAS values. Plus, I felt fully suppported through each challenge my own disability, age, gender, and unfamiliarity with archives and the professional sphere in general presented this quarter.***

***What comes next is finishing my school assignments (DONE AS OF 1/3/2024!) and finding a way to thank Dean and my professors Helene Williams and Chance Hunt, apart from my continued participation in their UW courses (I will have both professors again this quarter) and at the PNRA. As I am no longer Dean's intern, my role will be slightly different. These days, I'm just Dean's friend with a hundred hours of tranining in wide-format scanning under my belt.***

***If anything you've read sounds appealing, fascinating, or otherwise fun, please consider dropping by the PNRA on a Tuesday at 25 SW 153rd St, Burien, WA 98166. There's a chance that I'll be there...a good chance, actually. Everybody knows me by name, and I appreciate the lunch stories as much as the academic work. There's something truly magic about this tiny place in the world, and I think you might love it too. Stay tuned for my EPP, and have yourself a wonderful New Year!***
